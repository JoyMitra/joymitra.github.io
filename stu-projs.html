      <p><b>Security Analysis of Contact Tracing Mobile Apps</b>: In the wake of the COVID-19 pandemic, governments around the world
      have developed contact tracing apps to track and limit the spread of the pandemic. However, critics have pointed out that the development
      of such apps have longterm consequences on the security and privacy of users using the apps.
      The goal of this project is to use security analysis tools to analyze these apps for vulnerabilities and privacy violations.</p>
      
      <p> The first phase of this project (completed) focussed on US-based apps. Read the <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2207.08978">manuscript</a> for more information. Future work will involve apps from other countries.</p>
